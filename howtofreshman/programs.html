        <p>A lot of companies are looking for juniors (rising seniors) because they are in their penultimate year. This means that if they intern in between their junior and senior year, then they are eligible for a return offer for full-time conversion, which is convenient for a company since they can recruit full-time new grad employees from their intern pool.</p>

        <p>This is one reason it is hard for freshmen to land internships. Another is that upperclassmen generally have more experience, so they are more qualified candidates. However, this does not mean that it is impossible for freshmen to land internships!</p>
        
        <p>There are freshman-specific internships that are easier for freshmen to get into because they are not competing with upperclassmen.</p>
        
        <p>These internships may have downsides depending on the specific company because sometimes the projects they give to the interns are different from projects they give to regular interns.</p>
        
        <p>For example, in Google STEP, you are paired with another STEP intern and do pair programming, but in the regular Google internship, you have sole ownership over your project.</p>
        
        <p>Note: These are different from freshman-friendly companies that are willing to hire freshmen but do not treat them differently from other interns.</p>
        
        <p>Note: This is also different from freshman-specific programs, which are more like events where you can learn more about a specific company and maybe go on a fun trip if it is in-person in a different city.</p>
