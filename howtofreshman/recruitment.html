        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> The main purpose of this page is to help make recruiting information more accessible. 
            Recruiting is really hard. Don't feel down if you feel that you are behind. 
            Often, we only see other people's successes, and it can be easy to forget how much effort, failure, and rejection <em>everyone</em> goes through.</p>
        <p> On this page, we provide a sample recuriting timeline to give you an idea of the order of the recuriting process.
            Know that everyone experiences recuriting differently. Please do not stress if your timeline looks different! 
            Recruiting can be very random. 
        </p>
        <p> The first semester of college will be very busy as you will be settling into a new place, meeting new people, and being in college for the first time! 
            It is 100% ok and normal for freshmen to start applying after the end of fall semester. Don't sweat it if you want to wait and settle in before focusing on internships. 
            It's ok to take time to adjust, and it can be beneficial as well to wait until you can put projects from Data Structures on your resume.
            There are plenty of opportunities available for freshmen in the spring semester, and lots of freshmen that start applying in winter break and get offers around Spring Break or later. 
        </p>
        <p> Internships/industry is also not the only path. Plenty of people in Turing do research over the summer, especially the summer after freshman year. 
            Summer classes are also a great way to keep learning and working on your degree. 
            This page is more meant to be a guide for those who are interested in potentially doing an internship so they have more information accessible to them!
        </p>
        <p>
            Upperclassmen are super nice! You can ask your Big or pretty much anyone to review your resume and give you mock interviews. Don't be shy! Turing is a super supportive community

        <h2>Example Interview</h2>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>The interviewer introduces themselves, and you introduce yourself.</p>
            <p>They might ask a few basic questions at the beginning (e.g., “What are you majoring in?”, “What school do you go to?”) to learn about you.</p>
            <p>They might even ask one or two short behavioral questions (e.g., “Why are you interested in our company?”, “Why did you decide to major in computer science?”).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>2. Interview Format Explanation</h3>
            <p>The interviewer will explain the format of the interview.</p>
            <p>This is usually very formulaic (e.g., “You will have 30 minutes to solve 2 questions, and then we will leave 5 minutes at the end so that you can ask any questions you have about the company or the internship program.”).</p>
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If the interviewer does not explicitly state how many coding questions there are, then ask! This will help you to budget your time accordingly. It sucks when you assume there is only 1 question, so you spend 30 minutes on it, and then you only have 15 minutes left for the 2nd question.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>3. Describing the Coding Question(s)</h3>
            <p>The interviewer will describe the coding question(s).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>4. Clarify the Coding Question(s)</h3>
            <p>Do not jump straight into writing code. Make sure you understand the question first and ask some clarifying questions if you have any (e.g., “Can the only input be alphanumeric characters? What about spaces?”, “Am I correct to assume that given this input, this will be the output?”).</p>
            <p>Feel free to walk through a test case or propose edge cases here to make sure you understand the question.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>5. Describe Potential Solution</h3>
            <p>After you understand the question, describe a potential solution. It is important that you and the interviewer are on the same page for your solution. This allows the interviewer a chance to redirect you if they do not like your solution (e.g., the time complexity is too slow and they are looking for a more optimized solution, or your solution does not work, so they can give hints to help you figure out the answer).</p>
            <p>Feel free to write some pseudocode or draw pictures (if the format of the interview allows) or do whatever you need to communicate your solution.</p>
            <p>Another reason why it is good to describe your solution first is so that if you are short on time and do not finish coding your solution, at least you have described the intuition behind your idea. This will help your interviewer see that you understand the problem/solution so that they can still give you a favorable review.</p>
            <p>It is worse if you are halfway through writing code that the interviewer does not understand, and then the interview finishes. It is also not beneficial if you write a solution that works, but you are unable to explain why or help your interviewer understand.</p>
            <p>The goal of the interview is not just to get the answer right, but to show your thinking process (critical thinking skills) and your communication skills. They are also evaluating how easy you would be to work with, not only how smart you are.</p>       
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>6. Solving the Coding Problem(s)</h3>
            <p>Once your solution has been approved, begin writing real code in your language of choice.</p>
            <p>Feel free to test small portions of your code along the way (e.g., if you need to make an intermediate data structure to store some information, feel free to print it and make sure it looks right before you move on to writing more code).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step"></div>
            <h3>7. Test the Solution</h3>
            <p>Now, you can test your solution. Suggest some edge cases and potential solutions (and even test those edge cases if you have time).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>8. Concluding Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Suggest some edge cases and potential solutions (and even test those edge cases if you have time). If you have more time, propose ways to make your solution more optimized or robust. No need to implement, but this is a good way to get some extra points.</p>
