        <p>If you have time, it can be useful to practice Leetcode to prepare for technical interviews.</p>
        <p>You can do stuff like <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice">Neetcode 150</a>, 
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions">Blind 75</a>, etc!</p>
        <p>Don't worry too much about grinding problems. This is mostly to get a feel for it if you have never done anything 
            like Leetcode before. It's helpful to be familiar with what this might look like, so you can also just watch a few 
            videos on Youtube to see what an example of a technical interview looks like if you are curious.</p>
        <p>It's also not super useful to spam problems as you probably won't have great retention for the actual underlying 
            concepts (which are far more important than memorizing solutions). If you are intent on prepping Leetcode, it might
             be more useful to do 1 problem a day, and pretend that you are solving the problem in an interview so talk out loud
              and walk a fake person through the process. This will help you practice communicating your ideas and hopefully force
               you to engage more in the problem so that you have better retention of the knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>A technical interview will often ask you to solve 1 or 2 coding questions in 30-45 minutes. Usually, you can choose what 
            coding language to solve the problems in (e.g. Java or Python).</p>
