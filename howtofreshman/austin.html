        <h2>Welcome to Austin!</h2>
        <p>
            We're happy to have you join us in this wonderful city.

        <h2>Housing</h2>
        <p>
            Most freshmen choose to live on campus, and Turing Scholars typically live on the Honors Quad. 
            It's recommended to start looking for next year's housing early--ususally people start in September. 
        </p>
        <h3>West Campus</h3>
        <p>
            Most people go here. It's a fun area with college vibes where you'll find restaurants, shops, and endless apartment buildings. 
            It's great if you want to live near fellow students.
        </p>
        <h3>North Campus</h3>
        <p>
            North of campus tends to be more residential and quiet. This is a great option if you're looking for a condo or house. Many grad students live here, 
            though you may be further from friends and campus. 
        </p>
        <h3>Remaining on Campus</h3>
        <p>
            Of course, campus is another option! Some students will be RAs or simply stay in the dorms. Priority is given to incoming freshmen, so indicate this 
            preference early to secure your spot.
