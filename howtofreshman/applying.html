        <h2>Apply, Apply, Apply</h2>
        <p>Apply anywhere and everywhere - don't be super picky as a freshman!</p>

        <p>Don't just apply to a few (~10, 20) high-profile companies! It's pretty normal to cast a very wide net (e.g. ~100, 200) companies. 
            You don't have to do this, but if you want better chances of getting an internship, then you should play the numbers game.</p>

        <p>To know when new internships are posted, you can either subscribe to some sort of email notification service 
            (there are a lot of them, I've heard of swe-list for example). I personally prefer checking the Simplify GitHub repository 
            every morning and applying to all of the new postings in the last 24 hours since I last checked.</p>

        <p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships">Simplify Summer 2025 Internship Repository</a>. 
            You can probably navigate from here or Google for the repository relevant to your recruiting season (e.g. Fall 2024 recruiting
            season means you should look for the Summer 2025 GitHub repo).</p>

        <p>Note: A special shoutout to Simplify. It's a great Google Chrome extension I highly recommend to get because it will autofill 
            information for you to avoid retyping it, which saves a ton of time. I also recommend saving your answers to short-response questions 
            in some type of document as a lot of these questions are similar and you can reuse your answers.</p>

        <p>Note: If you are out-of-state and in the process of getting in-state tuition, you will probably need to work in Texas over the summer 
            to qualify for in-state, so you should apply to Texas places. Otherwise, I would not be really picky with location since experience 
            is experience, and that is what you need as a freshman. Same goes with pay! Experience is experience even if it does not pay as much 
            as you had hoped.</p>

    <section id="track">
        <h2>Keep Track!</h2>
        <p>Keep track of where you applied!</p>
        <p>I use a Google Sheet that lists the company, a link to the application, 
            the status of the application (rejected, online assessment, interview, accepted), 
            any additional notes (pay, location, etc).
