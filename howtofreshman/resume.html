        <h2>Template</h2>
            <p>You can use any of the UT resume templates, like the UT CNS template (they have a CS specific template).</p>
            <p>I personally recommend making your resume in Latex (but use whatever you are comfortable with, e.g. Google Docs or Microsoft Word)
                 - there is a popular Latex template called Jakeâ€™s resume template that you can Google (there are several versions so pick one you like best).
            </p>
            <p>I personally use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/npmbvrbvthpd#bb3114">this template</a></p>
            <p>Get your resume reviewed by anyone you trust. Take their advice with a grain of salt as everyone has different opinions. 
                For example, some people recommend the Technologies/Skills section as the first or second section, and some people 
                recommend it as the last section. It's a good idea to listen to their reasoning and understand why and then make your own decision.
            </p>
            <p>Note: I will say that in my opinion, Education should be the first section since you are currently in college and recruiters are 
                interested in knowing what school you attend and what year you will graduate so you should make this information easily accessible.</p>

        <h2>Resume Building</h2>
        <p>If you feel like you don't have enough CS-specific experience, that's ok! It can still be good to put down experience such as tutoring, 
            clubs, etc from high school as those are still your experiences and show that you are an active member of your community.
        </p>
        <p>In the meantime, you can work on personal projects (an easy one I recommend is making a full-stack app by following a tutorial, 
            and then expanding on the tutorial by adding whatever you want).
        </p>
        <p>You can also wait until partway through the fall or spring semester (winter break) to start applying so that you can list projects from 
            Data Structures on your resume (school projects are 100% valid to put on your resume and you don't even have to mention it's a school 
            project - but make sure not to publicize any source code).</p>
