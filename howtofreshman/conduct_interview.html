        <p>Feel free to ask any upperclassmen for mock interviews first!</p>

        <p>Interviewing is a skill, and it's super normal to be nervous before your first interview. But once you've done it a few times, you'll get the hang of it and they can even be fun!</p>
        
        <p>Remember that the interviewer is on your side. They have already given you time out of their busy day, so they are looking for reasons to hire you - otherwise they are wasting their time!</p>
        
        <p>Send a Thank You email to the interviewer after the interview is over.</p>
        
        <p>Not all candidates do this, but you should do this to leave a positive impression and to potentially stand out from candidates that forget.</p>
